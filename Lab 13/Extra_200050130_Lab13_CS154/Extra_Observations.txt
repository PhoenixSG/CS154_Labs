Hello, these are some more programs. Earlier the instructions were to do some programs of the slides, so I did 5.
Now, the instructions are to do all so I am doing the rest of the programs as well.

mahabharat.pl, cut2.pl-

I typed out both of these programs. They are both working correctly.

-> The first one is a very basic program showing various relations between different atoms.
We have also defined non-direct relations, like grandparents, grandmother, grandfather and grandchild.

We have been able to define these using some non-conventional methods, using only child and wife relations.
They thus do not give the whole set of solutions. But whatever solution they give is correct/true.



-> The second one also has a ! operator. This means that it stops after giving the first correct answer.
This is very clear from the execution of the program since we see that we do not need to press ; after the first output.
The program automatically returns yes and closes after first output.

If we remove the ! from the code, then we get 2 answers, ie. the program keeps on backtracking until it goes through all the possibilities.

Thus we learnt about relations and cut operator from these 2 programs.

Thank you!

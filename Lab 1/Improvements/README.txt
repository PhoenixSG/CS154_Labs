Hi! I am Shashwat Garg, 200050130. Here are some of my improvements in the program.


1.  I have included comments with the Author's name and Aim of the program at the beginning, as per good programming practices.

2.  Purely C language has been used in case of procedural approach.
    Doing this led me to explore more properties and functions of the C language which I didnâ€™t know before.

3.  Command line inputs have been implemented in program2 as well.

4.  I have modified the algorithm of program1.
    It does not store the results of individual rolls any longer, and just stores information required for the final result.
    Consequently the algorithm runs faster and can handle much larger inputs.

5.  The program is written to handle all (mostly) kinds of inputs and the code has been written accordingly.

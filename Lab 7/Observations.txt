Hello, I am Shashwat Garg, 200050130. Below are my observations while improving one of my earlier codes in Lab # .

I already had an idea about structured programming. I have not used statements like goto, or thrown exceptions in earlier labs.
As a result, I dont exactly have a lot to improve in terms of structure of my code.


I found that I was lacking in some aspects like putting less comments, or making the functions too specific in many cases.
I found that though my program was well structured, it was not written with the hope that someone would have to maintain or upgrade that in the future.

To improve upon this aspect, I have improved my code to include more comments, use more variables to promote variations, and also divide functions into even smaller ones.
This would enable better readability and improve maintainability of the code.

Some improvements are listed here-

1. Added a lot of comments, showing the purpose of every block of code
2. Removed the setx() and sety() functions and incorporated the code into the constructor to reduce redundancy
3. The color decision is now handled in the Shape() constructor since color is a part of Shape class
4. Removed some of redundant MyCircle functions
